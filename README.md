## Project Introduction

Our application, built with React + Vite, Node.js and MongoDB database, delivers a bookclub where people can sign up to become a subscribed member, receive a monthly book, and post books that they would like to read to an interactive feed.

## Technologies

### Frontend

Our app provides:

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Navigation using React Router
- Intuitive and accessibility approved interface
- Responsive design (320-1600px) across different browsers

### Backend

Our backend handles:

- One database with two synced collections using MongoDB
- Two RESTful API models using Express.js to handle the bookclub users and to post a book to the feed

## How to use the app

You can use our app as a bookclub member or non-member. As a non-member, you can read about the bookclub founders, the bookclub details, and register to become a member at the "Sign up" page.

Once you become a member, you will have access to the "Wishlist" page where you can submit book suggestions to a feed, like/unlike other posts, and sort the posts. You can also go to your "Profile" page and update your contact information as well as delete your subscription.
